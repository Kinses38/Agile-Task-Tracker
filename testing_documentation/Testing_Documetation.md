**Unit Tests** 
===============
We have written a number of tests written that can be run through leiningen, our build automation and dependency management tool. The tests can be run with the following command

```
lein doo phantom test once
```

Within our code project structure we have a test folder which contains cljs tests for our project. When the above command is entered, leiningen looks within this folder for the file "doo_runner.cljs". This file define which testing files are to be run.

![](media/lein-tests.png)

Here we have the output from running our tests. You can see that the tests written for task-portlet.cljs, ajax.cljs, backlog.cljs and deactivate-sprint.cljs, have all completed successfully.

And here you can see the sample output for when I cause one of the tests to fail, which alerts you to how many and which tests failed, and what the expected and actual results of the test were.
